|--------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `upload_file`      | Uploads a file from your local system to an S3 bucket.| Large file uploads, simple file transfers from disk.                              | Automatically handles multipart uploads; retries on failure.            | Only works with files on disk; not suitable for in-memory data.         |
| `upload_fileobj`   | Uploads a file-like object to an S3 bucket.                                  | Uploading in-memory files (e.g., BytesIO), streaming data.                        | Flexible with file-like objects; supports multipart uploads.            | Requires manual handling of file-like objects.                          |
| `put_object`       | Uploads raw bytes or a string directly to S3.                                | Small files, metadata updates, quick object creation.                             | Simple and direct; supports metadata and ACLs.                          | No automatic multipart upload; less efficient for large files.          |
| `download_file`    | Downloads a file from S3 to your local system.                               | Large file downloads, saving S3 objects to disk.                                  | Handles multipart downloads; retries on failure.                        | Only works with files on disk; not suitable for in-memory processing.   |
| `download_fileobj` | Downloads an S3 object to a file-like object.                                | Streaming downloads, in-memory processing, working with BytesIO.                  | Flexible with file-like objects; good for streaming.                    | Requires manual handling of file-like objects.                          |
| `get_object`       | Retrieves an object from S3, including its metadata and content.             | Reading object content directly, accessing metadata, streaming small files.       | Returns metadata and content; supports range requests.                  | Less efficient for large files; no automatic multipart download.        |
